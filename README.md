# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains implementations of design patterns described in the book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*. Each pattern is implemented in Java, and new patterns will be added over time as part of an ongoing learning process.

## About the Repository
This project serves as a personal challenge focused on learning and implementing reusable, elegant, and loosely coupled code solutions. It also serves as a reference and learning tool for developers interested in exploring design patterns. Each implementation includes well-documented code to explain the structure and purpose of the pattern.

### Prerequisites

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
> The version used for writing and compiling this code was JDK 21.

### How to Run
To test the code, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the program:**
In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `src` folder and run the following command:
```bash
javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/<main_class>.java
```
2. **Run the program:**
Once compiled, run the code with this command:
```bash
